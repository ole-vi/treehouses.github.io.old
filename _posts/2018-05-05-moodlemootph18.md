Last April we speak at MoodleMoot Philippines 2018 where we talk about our progress in packaging Learning Management System (LMS) especially Moodle and introducing [treehouses/remote](https://github.com/treehouses/remote/issues) to the audience.

The story is a little bit funny. One of the organizers of the MoodleMoot Philippines was sending me a message and inviting me to connect on LinkedIn. She reads that I have a little bit experience with Moodle and ask me if I interested attending the conference. I don't know why, but I automatically answered by not only attending if possible I want to speak there talk about our advancement in deploying Moodle LMS in small devices like Raspberry Pi. Then the rest is history. Yeah, there was a time where I invited to talk directly in Manila, but because I don't have a budget for that I talk about my constraint and then they offer me an options to talk remotely and turned out not only me that talking in this conference remotely, there are also some other presenter even from outside Asia.

The story was started from a small project to setup a simple LMS in Madagascar, and at that time our primary LMS, which is BeLL-Apps is in maintenance mode and our new LMS Planet is still under development. We then decide to use Moodle to bootstrap the project and deploy it in Madagascar. The problem back then is we want to have the stuff running both in amd64 (server) and also arm devices which is Raspberry Pi (specifically RPi 3).
