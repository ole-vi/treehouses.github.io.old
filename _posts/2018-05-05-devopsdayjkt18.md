Last April we speak at DevOpsDay Jakarta 2018 where we talk about our progress in packaging Learning Management System (LMS) in Raspberry Pi and how we leverage DevOps principle while developing the solution rapidly.

My first software conference is PyCon Indonesia 2017 where I talk about load testing and performance engineering of application with a simple little tool called Locust. It was gaining some interest from the audience it got me very excited and want to talk more about my experience. You know, for an introvert coder like me, having some public speaking exercise is always exciting and not. Very exciting because I can learn how I communicate, and not because we are shy.

So, when there is an opportunity to talk at DevOpsDay Jakarta, I think about my contribution here in Open Learning Exchange and decide to talk about our so-called DevOps practice and hopefully, it is inspire other people and organizations.
